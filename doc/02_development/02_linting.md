# Linting

To ensure unified standards in the project, the following linters are applied during commit.

## 🐍 Python conventions

To enforce unified standards in all python files, we use [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), which is a wrapper for the following three tools:

- PyFlakes
- pycodestyle
- Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script

. More details on it can be found in the documentation of Flake8.

## 💬 Markdown Linter

To enforce unified standards in all markdown files, we use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli). More details on it can be found in the according documentation.

The markdown linter can fix some errors on its own by executing `b5 markdown:fix`.

## 🚨 Common Problems

Currently, we are not aware about any Problems.
