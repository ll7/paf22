## Git workflow

### Git Feature Branch

![Git Feature](../00_assets/git-flow.svg)

#### Branch strategy

---

Two types of branches:

* Main: contains production ready code
* Feature: new branches based on main for each feature

## Git style

### Branch naming

---
Feature branch: issue number-description-of-issue      (separator: '-') generated by Github automatically

#### For example

Issue #28 called "Setup dev environment"

=> `28-setup-dev-environment`

**Note: You won't need to manually create these branch names in most cases -
GitHub does it for you, when you create a new branch from the issue you are working on.**

### Commit messages

---

* proceed to [Commit Messages](./03_commit.md)
