## How to comment on a pull request

* Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why this Pull Request exists.
* If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding; think before you react.
* Ask, don‚Äôt tell. (‚ÄúWhat do you think about trying‚Ä¶?‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
* Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in line with the style guide? A personal preference?)
* Offer ways to simplify or improve code.
* Avoid using derogatory terms, like ‚Äústupid‚Äù, when referring to the work someone has produced.
* Be humble. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, let‚Äôs try‚Ä¶‚Äù)
* Avoid hyperbole. (‚ÄúNEVER do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
* Aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product quality, through group critique.
* Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive language as opposed to neutral?
* Use emoji to clarify tone. Compare ‚Äú‚ú® ‚ú® Looks good üëç ‚ú® ‚ú®‚Äù to ‚ÄúLooks good.‚Äù

## Incorporating feedback

### Responding to comments

* Consider leading with an expression of appreciation, especially when feedback has been mixed.
* Ask for clarification. (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand, can you clarify?‚Äù)
* Offer clarification, explain the decisions you made to reach a solution in question.
* Try to respond to every comment.
* Link to any follow up commits or Pull Requests. (‚ÄúGood call! Done in 1682851‚Äù)
* If there is growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if the written word is still the best form of communication. Talk (virtually) face-to-face, then mutually consider posting a follow-up to summarize any offline discussion (useful for others who be following along, now or later).

### Applying suggested changes

If the reviewer not only left comments but also made specific suggestions on code parts, as shown  in [How to review](#how-to-review), you can incorporate them straight away.

1. Go to the corresponding pull request on GitHub
2. Navigate to the first suggested change
3. If you want to commit that change in a single commit, click ``Commit suggestion``
4. If you want to put more changes together to a single commit, click ``Add suggestion to batch``
![img.png](../00_assets/Commit_suggestion.png)
5. In the commit message field, type a short and meaningful commit message according to the [commit rules](./03_commit.md)
6. Click ``Commit changes``

### Re-requesting a review

If you made substantial changes to your pull request and want to a fresh review from a reviewer, contact him directly. It is appropriate to ask the same reviewer from the initial pull request as he/she is most familiar with the pull request.

### Resolving conversations

If a comment of a review was resolved by either, a new commit or a discussion between the reviewer and the team that created the pull request, the conversation can be marked as resolved by clicking ``Resolve conversation`` in the ``Conversation`` or ``Files Changed`` tab of the pull request on GitHub.
If a new commit took place it is encouraged to comment the commit SHA to have a connection between comment and resolving commit
