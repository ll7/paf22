**Summary:** This page explains the GitHub build action we use to first:

- create an executable image of our work
- evaluate our Agent with the leaderboard

## General

The workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build.yml) creates an executable image
which can later be submitted to the [CARLA leaderboard](https://leaderboard.carla.org) and pushes it
to [GitHub Packages](ghcr.io).

The image can then be pulled with `docker pull ghcr.io/ll7/paf22:latest` to get the latest version
or `docker pull ghcr.io/ll7/paf22:<version>` to get a specific version.

If action is triggered by a pull request the created image is then used to execute a test run in the leaderboard, using
the devtest routes. The results of this simulation are then added as a comment to the pull request.

## The Dockerfile ([`build/docker/build/Dockerfile`](../../build/docker/build/Dockerfile))

The Dockerfile uses [Dockerfile+](https://github.com/edrevo/dockerfile-plus) to include
the [agent Dockerfile](../../build/docker/agent/Dockerfile) to avoid duplicate code.
The code folder is then copied into the container instead of mounting it as in our dev setup.

## The `build-and-push-image` job

### 1. Checkout repository ([`actions/checkout@v3`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))

Trivial, just checks out the repo.

### 2. Set up Docker Buildx ([`docker/setup-buildx-action@v2`](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action))

Set's up Buildx. This is needed to set up the correct driver to allow caching in step 5.

Detailed description why this is needed can be
found [here](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/163#issuecomment-1053657228).

### 3. Log in to the Container registry ([`docker/login-action@v2`](https://github.com/docker/login-action))

Logs in with `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the registry (ghcr.io).

Example taken from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images)

### 4. Bump version and push tag ([`mathieudutour/github-tag-action`](https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action))

If the current commit is on the `main` branch, this action bumps the version and pushes a new tag to the repo.
Creates a new tag with a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) number for the release.
The version number is determinated by the name of the commits in the release.

This is possible since [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) are enforced by comlipy as
described [here](./02_linting.md).

#### Example

| Commit message                                         | Release type  | Previous version number | New version number |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| fix(#39): build failing due to incorrect configuration | Patch Release | 0.0.1                   | 0.0.2              |
| feat(#39): Add automatic build process                 | Minor Release | 0.0.1                   | 0.1.0              |

Major releases can be done manually (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0`).

### 5. Get commit hash

If Step 4 was skipped, this step gets the commit hash of the current commit, to be used as a tag for the Docker image.

### 6. Build and push Docker image

Build and push the image to the registry. To avoid large downloads of the base image
the [GitHub Actions cache](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/cache/backends/gha/)
is used to cache the image after build.
If the action is run on a branch other than `main`, the image is tagged with the commit hash from Step 5.
Otherwise, the image is tagged with both the tag created in Step 4 and `latest`.

## The drive job

The `drive` job is executed conditionally on `pull_request`, after the build successfully ran through.

### 1. Checkout repository ([`actions/checkout@v3`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))

Same step as in the [build job](#1-checkout-repository--actionscheckoutv3-)

### 2. Run agent with docker-compose

Runs the agent with the [`build/docker-compose.test.yml`](../../build/docker-compose.test.yml) that only contains the
bare minimum components for test execution:

- Carla Simulator (running in headless mode)
- roscore
- Agent container, run through the
  Carla [`leaderboard_evaluator`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/leaderboard/blob/leaderboard-2.0/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py).

### 3. Copy simulation results file out of container

Copies the created `simulation_results.json` file out of the agent container into the current container

### 4. Stop docker-compose stack

Stops the remaining containers (Carla, roscore) and removes the volumes with:
`$ docker-compose down -v`.

This step is important to clean up the remaining containers to have a clean run everytime. This is also the reason for
the `if: always()`, that ensures step execution.

### 5. Comment result in pull request [`actions/github-script@v6`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-script)

This steps uses a JS script to parse the simulation results and add a comment with a results table to the corresponding
pull request.

An example comment for this would be:
