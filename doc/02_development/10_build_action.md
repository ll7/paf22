## General

The workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build.yml) creates an executable image
which can later be submitted to the [CARLA leaderboard](https://leaderboard.carla.org) and pushes it
to [GitHub Packages](ghcr.io).

The image can then be pulled with `docker pull ghcr.io/ll7/paf22:latest` to get the latest version
or `docker pull ghcr.io/ll7/paf22:<version>` to get a specific version.

## The Dockerfile ([`build/docker/build/Dockerfile`](../../build/docker/build/Dockerfile))

The Dockerfile uses [Dockerfile+](https://github.com/edrevo/dockerfile-plus) to include
the [agent Dockerfile](../../build/docker/agent/Dockerfile) to avoid duplicate code.
The code folder is then copied into the container instead of mounting it as in our dev setup.

## The build process

### 1. Checkout repository ([`actions/checkout@v3`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))

Trivial, just checks out the repo.

### 2. Set up Docker Buildx ([`docker/setup-buildx-action@v2`](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action))

Set's up Buildx. This is needed to set up the correct driver to allow caching in step 5.

Detailed description why this is needed can be
found [here](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/163#issuecomment-1053657228).

### 3. Log in to the Container registry ([`docker/login-action@v2`](https://github.com/docker/login-action))

Logs in with `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the registry (ghcr.io).

Example taken from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images)

### 4. Bump version and push tag ([`mathieudutour/github-tag-action`](https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action))

If the current commit is on the `main` branch, this action bumps the version and pushes a new tag to the repo.
Creates a new tag with a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) number for the release.
The version number is determinated by the name of the commits in the release.

This is possible since [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) are enforced by comlipy as
described [here](./02_linting.md).

#### Example

| Commit message                                         | Release type  | Previous version number | New version number |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| fix(#39): build failing due to incorrect configuration | Patch Release | 0.0.1                   | 0.0.2              |
| feat(#39): Add automatic build process                 | Minor Release | 0.0.1                   | 0.1.0              |

Major releases can be done manually (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0`).

### 5. Get commit hash

If Step 4 was skipped, this step gets the commit hash of the current commit, to be used as a tag for the Docker image.

### 6. Build and push Docker image

Build and push the image to the registry. To avoid large downloads of the base image
the [GitHub Actions cache](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/cache/backends/gha/)
is used to cache the image after build.
If the action is run on a branch other than `main`, the image is tagged with the commit hash from Step 5.
Otherwise, the image is tagged with both the tag created in Step 4 and `latest`.
