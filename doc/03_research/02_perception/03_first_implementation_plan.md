## Overview

## Panoptic Segmentation

### Things and Stuff

#### Things

In computer vision, the term things generally refers to objects that have properly defined geometry and are countable, like a person, cars, animals, etc.

#### Stuff

Stuff is the term used to define objects that donâ€™t have proper geometry but are heavily identified by the texture and material like the sky, road, water bodies, etc.

### Segmentation Overview

There are three different kinds of image segmentation:

* **Semantic Segmentation**: \
    Classification of every pixel or point in an image or LIDAR map into different classes (car, person, street, ...)
* **Instance Segmentation**: \
    Detection of the different instances of things.
* **Panoptic Segmentation**: \
    Combination of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Detection of stuff plus instances of things.

### Image Panoptic Segmentation

Possible implementation with [EfficientPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02307.pdf).
This net has a pretty high panoptic quality of 64-67% and a relatively low calculation
time of 166ms on a 1024x2048 image.

### LIDAR Panoptic Segmentation

**Discussion**: \
This is probably necessary to get also an overview about entities that are not in the field of view of the cameras
like vehicles behind or next to the vehicle.

An efficient way to compute LIDAR panoptic segmentation is [EfficientLPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08009.pdf) ([Website](http://lidar-panoptic.cs.uni-freiburg.de/)).
It has a panoptic quality between 53% and 59% and a calculation time of 154-213ms depending on the chosen architecture.

## Position Validation

If some positioning sensors show a significant deviation, the task of this module is to
clear these deviations and to calculate the most accurate position possible.

---

## Obstacle Detection and Object Classification

This module is the first with a direct output into the planning layer. \
Its tasks are to combine the information given by the map, cameras, panoptic segmentation
and LIDAR (panoptic segmentation).

A possible way for the combination of camera and LIDAR data is e.g. a projection between
the semantic image and LIDAR points to generate a panoptic semantic LIDAR point cloud.

This enables to calculate bounding boxes for each thing and to get a precise overview about the surrounding stuff.

## Lane Detection

For lane detection, all occurring lines are classified (stop line, solid middle line, dashed middle line, etc.)
Based on this information, the lanes are classified (own lane, driveable, oncoming lane etc.). Information given by the
map and GNSS are used either.
No implementation plan yet.

## Traffic Light Detection

This module is responsible for the detection of traffic lights and the classification of their current state. \
It combines the information about position given by the map and Obstacle Detection and Object Classification Module and
the information about the state given by the camera images.

For state classification, the part showing the traffic light is snipped out of the camera image to get a better and
faster prediction due to a smaller image size and less information. To prevent the classification network to classify
the state always as orange on traffic lights with orange housings, the housing is masked out.
As classification net I would recommend the [net implemented by PAF21-1](https://github.com/ll7/paf21-1/blob/e5fa2941e11b5570780d256cfb7793f3bfd87ee5/components/perception/node/src/perception/traffic_light_detection/tld_training.py#L20).

Possible states are:

* green
* orange
* red
* off
* backside

## Traffic Sign Detection

This module is responsible for the detection of traffic signs and the classification of their state. \
It combines the information about position given by the map and Obstacle Detection and Object Classification Module and
the information about the state given by the camera images.

For state classification, the part showing the traffic sign is snipped out of the camera image to get a better and
faster prediction due to a smaller image size and less information.
Maybe the classification net for traffic light classification can be reused.

## Prediction

This module should output predictions about the future behaviour of other vehicles
(vehicle switches lane, etc.) or pedestrians (crosswalk).
No implementation plan yet.

## Possible Issues/Milestones

* Implement/Adapt panoptic segmentation model (EfficientPS)
* (Implement/Adapt) LIDAR panoptic segmentation model (EfficientLPS)
* Choose datasets for training
* Generate own training data for fine-tuning
* Implement classification net for traffic light/sign classification
* Find ways for lane detection
* Find solutions/implementations for the projection of LIDAR, Radar and image data
* Position validation necessary?
