## velocity_controller

To test the velocity controller, set the parameter ```enabled``` in the acting launch-file true. Now the velocity_publisher_dummy will publish dummy target speeds. Use ```rqt_plot /carla/hero/velocity_as_float /carla/hero/max_velocity``` to visualize target and current speeds.

## Dummys

To test the steering controllers and the acc there are two dummys:

* the ```DummyTrajectoryPub``` publishes a simple path to test the steering controllers on,
* the ```AccDistancePublisherDummy``` publishes a dummy distances to an imaginary vehicle in front

To activate these dummys, make sure that they are started in the launch file and ```<param name="enabled" value="True" />``` is set in the launch file.
