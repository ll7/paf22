# Dataset generator

**Summary:** The dataset generator located in perception/src/dataset_generator.py is a standalone script, directly
hooking into the Carla Python API. It is used to generate a dataset to train perception models.

## Necessary adjustments

Important to note: The dataset generator uses
the [instance segmentation camera](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.14/ref_sensors/#instance-segmentation-camera),
which is only available in Carla 0.9.14 and above.
Unfortunately, the leaderboard 2.0 is still based on Carla 0.9.13+, so to use the dataset generator,
the agent [Dockerfile](../../build/docker/agent/Dockerfile), as well as
the [docker-compose.yml](../../build/docker-compose.yml)
need to be adjusted:

## Usage

To run the dataset generator, first the Carla Simulator has to be running:

  ```bash
  b5 run carla-simulator
  ```

You can then run the dataset generator by executing the following command in the `b5 shell`:

```bash
python3 perception/src/dataset_generator.py --host carla-simulator --port 2000 --use-empty-world
```

With the `--use-empty-world` flag, the dataset generator will assume the Carla world to be empty and will spawn the ego
vehicle, as well as the traffic lights and the pedestrians manually. This is useful for debugging purposes.

After the dataset generator has been started, the Carla world will be populated with pedestrians and traffic lights and
the ego vehicle will be spawned and start driving around the map.

The dataset generator will record the images from the instance segmentation camera, as well as the corresponding rgb
camera images in four directions: `[center, left, right, back]`.

We then store these images in the output directory can be specified with the `--output-dir`
flag.

### Using with leaderboard

To use the dataset generator with the leaderboard, first start the leaderboard evaluation by adjusting the command in
the
[docker-compose.yml](../../build/docker-compose.yml) to run the leaderboard evaluator:

  ```yaml
  agent:
    # ...
    command: bash -c "sleep 10 && python3 /opt/leaderboard/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py --debug=0 --routes=/opt/leaderboard/data/routes_devtest.xml --agent=/opt/leaderboard/leaderboard/autoagents/npc_agent.py --host=carla-simulator --track=SENSORS"
    # ...
```

Once the leaderboard evaluator is running, you can start the dataset generator in the `b5 shell`:

```bash
python3 perception/src/dataset_generator.py --host carla-simulator --port 2000
```
