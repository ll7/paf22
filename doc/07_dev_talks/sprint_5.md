## Planning

### Suggestions

How should be the naming convention for topics?

traffic light message:

    string color
    float32 distance

traffic sign message:

    bool isStop
    float distance

speed limit message:

    float speedlimit
    float distance

acc message:

    bool activate/deactivate

### Things that need to handled

* Information from perception
  * Are there speed limits on the road? Can you handle these?
  * traffic signs are firstly limited to stop signs, I guess? Is the design modular enough to add different signs?
  * should there be a state as in the traffic light suggestion? Would keep the message short
  * is it alright to handle speed limits differently?
  * We might need to track crossing traffic for unsignalized intersections.

* Information from acting
  * is it simple enough to have a bool message?
  * Speed is published in m/s or km/h?
  * this message would only be used to de-active in case of overturn and put back on afterwards and otherwise the ACC could turn on automatically when the distance to the car in front is below a threshold?

### Results

Topic naming: /paf/hero/*

traffic light message:

    string color
    float32 distance

acc message:

    bool activate/deactivate
    

    
Open: 

traffic sign message:

    bool isStop
    float distance

speed limit message:

    float speedlimit in m/s
    float distance
    
* Perception
  * crossing traffic dependent on segmentation/lidar model accuracy 
  * speed limits are part of opendrive file/ could also have redundent street signs/

* Acting
  * Speed in m/s

## Acting

* Unpark routine/ other scenarios handled by acting/ hard coded behavior

## Perception

no questions so far
